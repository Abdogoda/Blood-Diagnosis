Working with cbc test:
	- create tests record in the database for the patient_id.
	- if the user upload csv file: add two columns in the file called Diagnosis, Predicted_Anemia having the prediction values.
	- if the user made a test with inputs: make an csv file with the input data and add the output columns.
	- save the updated file in uploads/tests/cbc with random name with datetime.
	- make a new test_files record with the csv file name, extension, path, type (output).
	- test still be pending until the doctor review it.
	- doctor can review only tests for his patients
	- if the patient is the one who made the test, he can request review from his linked doctors.
